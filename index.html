                <p class="hero">Digital goldmine, fools gambit, currency of future: all phrases used to describe the new and poorly understood technological phenomenon known as Bitcoin. It is, simply put, a digital currency. It exists not as a physical reality, but as a series of ownership certificates on a massive digital ledger. It is not vetted by any country or stored by any national bank; it exists only in person-to-person interactions.</p>

                <p class="semihero">The idea emerged in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, from a shadowy author named Satoshi Nakamoto as a currency intended to facilitate a step away from the traditional financial system. Upon implementation, its anonymity and the security enabled by its cryptographic underpinnings made it the currency of choice for buyers and sellers of illegal merchandise. Government crackdowns on these websites and growing belief that rapid deflation represented a “get rich quick” scheme drove the new online currency into the public spotlight. With more attention came even greater volatility. Prices over the last year have ranged from $13 a coin to more than $1000 (Yermack 2013). Despite its public popularity and a steady growth in the number of vendors willing to accept bitcoins, the road ahead looks very uncertain. The collapse of Mt.Gox, security issues with cloud-hosted wallets and mining pools, a Bitcoin ban in China, and IRS regulation are all putting Bitcoin’s survival into question. Can Bitcoin resolve its own security issues, adapt to government regulation, and emerge as a successful free currency? The answer to this question will undoubtedly influence the future of finance, privacy, and personal technology.</p>

                    <h1>The Bitcoin Protocol</h1>
                </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <h2>Origins</h2>

                        <p>Bitcoin is the name of a digital, online crypto-currency that emerged late in the 2000s. In 2008, a person(s) named <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> published a paper entitled <em><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a></em> to a mailing list focused on cryptography. To this day, the true inventor of the protocol has not been found.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of who created it, Bitcoin remains one of the most ingenious attempts at an online currency ever made. It is designed to prevent theft, provide anonymity, and self-regulate. Let&#8217;s see how it works.</p>

                        <h2>The protocol</h2>

                        <p>The technology that runs <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> follows a careful design in order to solve problems inherent to modern currencies. The US Dollar and the Euro rely on a trust based model, where central financial institutions control the flow of money. This can causes problems, as the financial centers are trusted to mediate disputes over transactions and decide on the amount of money in circulation. This is why the Bitcoin protocol is designed to rely on a different type of enforcement: &#8220;What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, 
                        allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted 
                        third party,&#8221; (Nakamoto 2008).</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin implements this concept by using a shared, global, complete ledger of all transactions that have ever occurred on the network. This is called the <a href="https://blockchain.info/"><strong>blockchain</strong></a>. When a person pays another person in bitcoins, that transaction is recorded in the ledger for the world to see. The computers on the network then use cryptography to verify this transaction as valid (they make sure that the person paying owns enough bitcoins to pay the designated amount and has not paid those bitcoins to anyone else beforehand). For this model to work, it relies on a few features of the protocol:</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>First, <strong>there are always a finite, gradually increasing number of bitcoins in existence at any time</strong>. Bitcoin users can compete to grab new bitcoins as they are added to the network, but doing so is difficult, as one would imagine it should be &mdash; it is virtually free money. This process is called <strong>mining</strong>, which is explained below.</li>
                        <li>Bitcoins are not physical or digital entities that are moved from owner to owner, but rather, all of the bitcoins in existence are always owned by someone, and <strong>when someone pays another person (a transaction), only the ownership over the bitcoins is transferred</strong>. </li>
                        <li>The <strong>blockchain is a ledger, a record of all the transactions</strong>. It holds the history of what bitcoins were owned by whom and when, and contains all of the verified transactions that have ever occurred up to the current point in time.</li>
                        <li>Because each transaction is simply a transfer recorded in the blockchain, it does not involve any of the traditional methods of payment, like credit, withdrawals, or deposits. Because of this, <strong>there is no need for any banks or central regulators</strong>. You either own bitcoins and can pay them to someone, or you don&#8217;t, and can&#8217;t.</li>
                        <li>Every transaction that happens on the network is verified using cleverly deployed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptography</a> run by an entire network of computers. Because the system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">distributed</a>, even if an attacker tried to trick one computer that they owned more bitcoins than they actually do, the rest of the network would recognize this as invalid, and the attack would be thwarted. In fact, <strong>in order for an attacker to reverse a single transaction, they would have to undo all of the computational effort performed to verify every single transaction that had happened since the transaction they are trying to reverse.</strong> For all intents and purposes, this can be considered impossible.</li>

                            <h3>Mining</h3>

                            <p>As we mentioned earlier, mining is the process by which one can earn new bitcoins as they are released into the network without having to buy them. In the early years of Bitcoin, mining was the primary method of getting bitcoins. To mine, all someone needs to do is run a program called a &#8220;miner&#8221; that connects to the network and does computational work in exchange for new coins. The work that the miner does is partially verifying the transactions that happen over the network and partially trying to compute mathematical codes called &#8220;hashes&#8221; that have a small chance at matching the next batch of bitcoins that will be released into the network for people to use. The first computer to guess the hash of this new batch, called a <strong>block</strong>, is awarded all of the bitcoins in that block.</p>

                            <p>As time goes on and more and more bitcoins are released into the network, guessing the correct hash becomes more and more difficult, meaning that more computational power is required to win the next block of coins. At this point, mining is so difficult that a single user on a personal computer has virtually no chance at successfully mining, since they would be competing against huge server farms with immense computing power dedicated to mining as many bitcoins as possible. To level the playing field most individuals team up in pooled mining efforts, where a large number of relatively weak miners team up as part of a larger mining effort and split whatever winnings they can muster.</p>

You are responsible for keeping it in a safe place, and anything from an accidental deletion to forgetting a password could result in the loss of all of your bitcoins.

However, bitcoin exchanges and digital wallets are not regulated in the same way as banks are. You are completely trusting the moderators of that site to keep your money safe. If they turn out to be unsavory, you could lose everything. Online wallets offer convenience at the expense of safety.

A large group of miners work together in a distributed computing effort. Because the power of the mining operation is increased, the likelihood of earning bitcoins is increased. Then, the winnings are distributed to everyone who participated, weighted by their contribution. This is almost definitely the more appealing option. You do, however, risk not getting a perfectly fair shake, and you are again competing against every miner in the pool for the same winnings.

                        <h2>Technical Breakdown</h2>

                        <p>Despite the seeming invulnerability of Bitcoin, its roots in computer software and the Internet leave it open to an uncertain future. It is difficult to question the resilience it has shown so far. After all, it has spent years in operation with only very minor flaws discovered and quickly fixed. The design of the protocol itself is very strong and resistant to manipulation, and the software implementation has survived thus far without any serious flaws. However, it is this software that ultimately might prove to be vulnerable. Even the most heavily guarded systems at the world&#8217;s foremost banks, payment processors, and security companies regularly fall under attack and perfect security is an elusive beast in the software world. Developers trying to keep a system secure seem always to be taking continuous steps forward, without ever reaching complete security. From what we&#8217;ve seen of software in the past, it would be unwise of the world, if widespread Bitcoin adoption were ever to take place, to place its financial trust entirely on a piece of software written by a single group of people, simply because it has historically proven safe. There is always the chance a vulnerability might be found in the future, and when money is at stake, that is never a small risk.</p>

                        <p>There is also growing concern about the sustainability of the mining workforce. As the network grows, mining becomes <a href="http://bitcoindifficulty.com/">increasingly difficult</a>. The popularity of bitcoin has created something of an arms race within the mining community, with everyone from individuals with racks of <abbr title="Application-specific Integrated Circuit: Specialized hardware commonly used to mine bitcoins">ASIC</abbr>s to companies deploying <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/business/100000002607442/mining-for-bitcoins-in-iceland.html">server farms</a>, all competing to earn new bitcoins as they are released. In November 2013, the combined computing power of all bitcoin miners was estimated to be about 100 times that of the world&#8217;s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined ("Bitcoin under pressure" The Economist 2013). The question is, what will happen if these miners stop mining. The system might sustain itself, but no one really knows for sure. Without miners to process the network&#8217;s transactions, the currency could fail due to technical challenges.</p>

                        <h2>The Trust Model Resurfaces</h2>

                        <p>Aside from any technological flaws, there is one massive problem in the Bitcoin, and it is the one causing most of the headlines about the perceived danger of Bitcoin. The issue exists not in the protocol, as described on the <a href="#tech" class="pageLink">previous page</a>, but rather in the way people have decided to use Bitcoins in the real world. Instead of keeping their own bitcoins on their own devices and making payments exclusively in bitcoins to other bitcoin addresses using the original software, the vast majority of users rely on online services to facilitate their use of the cryptocurrency. These services take many forms:</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>Bitcoin exchange</strong> (example: <a href="https://www.bitstamp.com/">BitStamp</a>) is a website where users can go to exchange bitcoins for physical currencies (and vice versa) with other users. </li>
                        <li>An <strong>online Bitcoin wallet</strong> (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">examples</a>) is a website where users can store their wallets online for safekeeping, so that they can be accessed from anywhere, and so that they won&#8217;t be lost of their personal computers suffer damage. These are explained on the <a href="#tech" class="pageLink">technology page</a> in more detail.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>mining pool</strong> (example: <a href="https://ghash.io/">ghash.io</a>) is described in the <a href="#tech" class="pageLink">technology page</a> and also depends on users&#8217; trust in the pool they join.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Their services offer convenience and (likely) financial benefits, but they require that their users place a certain level of trust in them. In each of these services, the website has a certain ability to either defraud its users (either by malice ― they could intentionally steal bitcoins ― or incompetence ― a security hole in their own software might result in the loss of customer data, which might include wallets full of customers&#8217; money) or to unfairly levy fees on their users (for example, a mining pool whose owners take a large cut of the earnings before dividing them up among the users who actually earned them).</p>

                        <p>The same concerns might be raised for traditional fiat currencies. After all, PayPal takes away a percentage of all money transferred with it. Target recently lost thousands of customers&#8217; credit card information during a hack. But these things aren&#8217;t the same. To start, the places where we deposit normal currencies (banks) are insured by the FDIC for up to $100,000. A bitcoin user has no such guarantees, at least until the currency gains more recognition by global authorities (see the <a href="#economics" class="pageLink">economics page</a> for more details). Second, PayPal is regulated by federal trade authorities and has to abide by certain financial laws designed to protect consumers from unfair behavior. Credit cards are protected against fraud, so the Target hack was containable. When a shady online bitcoin wallet decides to steal every user&#8217;s money, there is nowhere to turn for assistance. You cannot save the money in your Bitcoin wallet if it gets stolen like you can for your bank account if your credit card number is taken. </p>

                        <p>The ultimate issue is that when people use Bitcoin in the ways many of them do now, they place <strong>trust</strong> in the companies and services that make dealing with bitcoins easier. Until Bitcoin is regulated to the point where consumer protections can be put in place, this fact will always be a massive security flaw in Bitcoin. And even if those regulations are put in place, it could mean placing the same trust in a central authority to regulate the currency that Satoshi Nakamoto was trying to avoid in the first place. The currency created to avoid the &#8220;Trust Model&#8221; might once again be subject to it. </p>

                            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">Mt.Gox</a> was, until recently, one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges in the world, with thousands of users buying and selling bitcoins on the site every day. In fact, it was so large that the US Federal Government had in Feburary 2013 siezed millions of dollars in assets from the company for allegedly violating federal money transfer regulations (Dillet 2013). In February 2014, the company realized that for months, hackers had been covertly stealing the wallets of many of their users from Mt.Gox&#8217;s servers. In a leaked internal &#8220;Crisis Strategy Draft,&#8221; the company outlined the depth of their losses: 744,000 btc, or approximately $400 million of customers&#8217; assets had been stolen in the attack (Mt.Gox 2014). And because of the permanence and anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, they were gone forever. </p>

Mr. Karpelès was subpoenaed by the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to appear for questions in Washington, D.C. in April 2014 (Kumar 2014), and Mt.Gox was liquidated in the same month (Mochizuki &amp; Stech 2014). <span class="attr">Source: Flickr user Filippo</span></p>

                        <p>As a technological phenomenon, Bitcoin’s anonymity and convenience have excited tech geeks the world over. Bitcoin’s ideological roots, however, run much deeper than making buying groceries more secure. It represents the ultimate rejection of fiat currency, or currency backed by a state or government. It was dreamt up in 2008 at a time when trust in the world’s major financial and economic systems were in chaos and the government regulation controlling them was at an all time low. Created to exist without a currencies typical reliance on a central bank, it represents the ultimate “hands off my money,” anti-government, Austrian economics-driven currency system. As Paul Krugman likes to describe it, “Bitcoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind—to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions,” (Krugman 2013).</p>

                        <p>Regardless of your personal economic opinions, it is undeniable that Bitcoin has and will continue to shake up our economic system. Just as the Internet has so radically decentralized everything from transportation to socializing, so too does Bitcoin provides user with “permissionless monetization”. (Parker 2014) It has truly laid the foundation for financial innovation in the 21st century. </p>

                        <h2>Is Bitcoin a viable form of currency?</h2>

                        <p>As a form of money, Bitcoin offers some distinct advantages. It is a peer-to-peer medium of exchange, so it remains free of the influence of government or bank regulation and supervision. This means that moving money across state and international borders becomes both cheaper and easier than before. For migrant and international workers this could radically reduce the costs of remittances and make living and working abroad an easier more convenient option. Additionally, Bitcoins are free of the normal bank charges and restrictions that so often plague clients. Bitcoin’s recent surge in popularity has made it very easy to find businesses willing to accept Bitcoin as payment. Even some prominent <a href="http://www.mondocellars.com/">California wineries</a> are taking Bitcoin payments. For normal buying and selling activities it is both more convenient and more secure than other forms of electronic payment like PayPal or even credit cards (Brito 2013).</p>

                            <h3>Drugs. Weapons. Bitcoins?</h3>

                                        Before its seizure by the FBI, Silk Road took advantage of the anonymity of Bitcoin and the <abbr title="The Onion Router">TOR</abbr> protocol to provide a marketplace for black market items.
                                    </p>

                            </div>

                            <p>Bitcoin's cryptographic protocols and lack of middlemen make it very easy to conduct business completely anonymously. Shortly after its release as a currency, criminal minds realized that this was a huge advantage in conducting illegal transactions. The website <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road</a>, which acted as the Amazon.com of drugs and narcotics, used Bitcoin as it’s only means of transaction. This prompted US Senator Charles Schumer to try and get Bitcoin banned, giving the fledgling currency a nearly unshakable bad reputation. Only after financial speculators began buying Bitcoins as a get rich scheme was its reputation as a means of transaction restored.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>While these features are very exciting and have lead to a real surge in popularity for the currency, the financial and economic deck is stacked against it. JP Morgan’s investment report sums it up best “Since governments are quite unlikely to accord it the status of legal tender, Bitcoin or other virtual currencies would not reach the scale and scope to render them worthwhile for widespread commerce, payments or investment” (Rizzo 2014). Despite a recent push by investors, <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/040814/winklevoss-bitcoin-payment-system-worth-400-billion.asp">including the Facebook famous Winkelvoss twins</a>, to create official government rules for regulating Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve remains too weary to take an active role in oversight (Brito 2013). Countries like China have <a href="http://on.wsj.com/1lXAlTT">outright banned the currency</a> and large banks are not turning to it as an investment or means of transaction. As Susan Athey, a professor at Stanford writes, “legitimate firms will have the resources and incentive to provide more sophisticated consumer protection and to develop and adopt best practices for security”, but without the support of these firms Bitcoin will continue to flounder (Parker 2014). </p>

                        <p>Bitcoin enthusiasts continue to argue that it cannot be subjected to the typical laws of economics. As an avant-garde currency, Bitcoin exists outside the current framework and its open source developer base will ensure its sustainability (Spotz 2014). Unfortunately for these enthusiasts the laws of economics are proving to be particularly rigid. As economist David Yermack points out currency is supposed to fill three roles:</p>

                        <ol>
                        <li>Medium of Exchange</li>
                        <li>Unit of Account</li>
                        <li>Store of Value</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Bitcoin, however, has <a href="https://coinbase.com/charts">3 to 4 times the volatility</a> of a normal stock making, it an extremely unreliable store of value or unit of account (Yermack 2014). Enthusiasts argue that exchange rate doesn’t matter as long as it is the medium of exchange. The world, however, remains rooted in fiat currency, and the employees and workers using bitcoins still have to live most of their lives on government issued currency. Bitcoin struggles not only with volatility, but also with illiquidity and deflation. Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be issued. Without an increasing currency supply, workers will have to take yearly pay cuts as prices fall (“Money from Nothing” The Economist 2014). The lack of government supervision also means that economic phenomenon like bank runs could easily devastate the currency’s value and the users’ fiscal lives.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>The economic case against Bitcoin is very strong and it is going to take a long time before problems with deflation, volatility, and reliability are solved. However, there is hope for virtual currencies as a whole. There is already another virtual currency called <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> that uses very similar protocols to Bitcoin, but in an effort to solve the deflation problem, plans to circulate nearly three times the number of coins that Bitcoin does (“Bitcoin Under Pressure” The Economist 2013). While Bitcoin may not be economically viable, perhaps it has laid the foundation for future virtual currencies that will be. </p>

                            <p>In the spring of 2014, the IRS <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/i-r-s-says-bitcoin-should-be-considered-property-not-currency">decided that Bitcoin should be treated as property and not as a currency</a>. Therefore, any movement of Bitcoins is treated as capital gains or capital losses. It is treated like a commodity, just like gold or oil. This means all buying and selling of bitcoins must be reported on a person’s taxes, which is exactly the sort of government regulation that Bitcoin users are looking to get away from (Caplinger 2014). The effects of this policy are still unclear, but the reverberations will be felt on laptops and Bitcoin wallets nationwide.</p>

                        <p>The future of Bitcoin remains obscured behind a list of mounting obstacles and a fervid public debate over its place in our society. We can say that they way Bitcoin has taken note of human tendencies and economic trends in order to create a reliable, self-sustaining system is nothing short of remarkable. The cryptographically secured, distributed blockchain ledger that forms the core of Bitcoin technology is an impressive, safe, and highly reliable protocol for transactions of any sort. If nothing else survives, the open source technology and the highly secure method of conducting transactions might well be incorporated into financial technology for many years to come. The idea of Bitcoin itself is innovative and has permanently changed the dialogue and debate surrounding financial markets, currency regulation, and fiscal privacy. It has put a strong and necessary spotlight on consumer protection and control of government and bank overreach, that will hopefully bring about a more secure and transparent system of financial interaction. </p>

                        <p>However, in its current form Bitcoin is riddled with weaknesses. While the protocol itself is secure, the third party websites that operate the wallets and provide Bitcoin services are anything but. Hacking and theft of digital wallets is disappointingly common, and the very security that Bitcoin promises is put in jeopardy by the businesses that surround it. These vulnerabilities can have catastrophic consequences, especially since a loss of confidence is the only thing that can actually bring Bitcoin down. A large-scale event such as this would leave the currency devastated and worthless. A peer-to-peer technology can&#8217;t be &#8220;taken down,&#8221; but without those peers, it cannot function. Even a fool-proof protocol won’t save Bitcoin if the users stop assigning it value. The same could be said of fiat currencies, but in those cases, governments exist to enforce that value.</p>

                        <p>The governments themselves might be Bitcoin&#8217;s biggest obstacle. No government wielding monetary influence wants Bitcoin to take hold. Their control over their own currencies allows them to manipulate their economies to achieve certain goals or to persuade other countries to take certain actions. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin would, by its very nature, reduce or even eliminate the effectiveness of monetary policy, a key tool for keeping economies from disaster. Even if Bitcoin could manage to escape the <em>sizeable</em> governmental opposition it now faces from powerful parties like the IRS and the People&#8217;s Bank of China, its rigidity might set up any large economy that adopts it for massive and irreversible failure.  </p>

                        <p>Economically, Bitcoin’s structural flaws will likely prevent it from being anything but a sideshow to normal fiat currencies. Its extreme price volatility and its basis in a society that remains married to fiat currencies prevent it from adequately storing value or holding the trust of its users. Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s limit of 21 million coins will set of an unprecedented stage of self-inflicted deflation that will prevent it from becoming the de facto currency of any community. Furthermore, Bitcoin is also hemmed in by the paradox in its own ideology. In order to survive, it has to integrate with current government rules and regulation ― the very thing it was designed to escape. Only if advocates give up their libertarian agenda could they reverse the trend of financial and governmental rejection of Bitcoin and ensure its survival. </p>

                        <p>It seems that cryptocurrencies&#8217; best chance of success may depend almost exclusively on constraining that success to a small, healthy scale.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin as an operational currency may not have long to live. Competitors with less myopic economic agendas like Litecoin are already stepping into the public eye and may soon supersede Bitcoin as the go-to digital currency. Regardless of its success of demise, Bitcoin has raised essential debates about financial privacy and may have laid the foundation for more successful digital currencies in the future. Only time will tell.</p>
